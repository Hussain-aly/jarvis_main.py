This project is a Python-based voice assistant inspired by AI assistants like Jarvis. It demonstrates how Python can be used to interact with a user's operating system and external applications through voice commands, providing a hands-on exploration of system automation and basic voice control.

How it Works

The assistant listens for specific voice commands from the user. Upon recognizing a command, it performs a predefined action, such as playing music or opening a specific application (e.g., Google Chrome, Facebook). If a command is not understood, it provides feedback to the user.

Key Features

Voice-Controlled Music Playback: Initiates music playback based on voice commands.

Application Launcher: Opens specified applications (e.g., web browsers, social media platforms) via voice.

Interactive Voice Interface: Responds to user commands and provides feedback.

Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language for the assistant's core logic.

speech_recognition (as sr): For converting spoken words into text commands.

webbrowser: For opening web-based applications.

pyttsx3: For the assistant's voice output (text-to-speech).

musicLibrary: (Note: This might be a custom module or a less common library. Ensure it's available or explain if it's a placeholder for a specific music playback method you implemented.)

Conditional Logic (if/elif/else): To interpret commands and trigger the correct actions.

Loops: To keep the assistant running and listening for continuous commands.

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Hussain-aly/jarvis-voice-assistant.git


Navigate to the project directory:

cd jarvis-voice-assistant


Install necessary libraries:

pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3
# Note: PyAudio might be needed for SpeechRecognition, but can be complex to install.
# If musicLibrary is a custom module, ensure it's in the same directory.


Run the assistant:

python jarvis_main.py


Future Enhancements (Optional)

Expand the range of commands and functionalities (e.g., setting reminders, fetching weather, telling jokes).

Integrate with online APIs for more dynamic responses (e.g., Google Search, news APIs).

Implement more advanced natural language understanding (NLU) for complex queries.

Improve voice recognition accuracy and speed.

My Role

This voice assistant was developed independently as a solo project.
